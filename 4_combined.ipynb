Our son is enrolled for the upcoming school year (kindergarten). \\n\\nWe looked into a bunch of schools, public, charter, and private, and Dawson was really our favorite. It just seemed to feel warm we got the vibe that the teachers really cared. \\n\\nFor example, we observed the 4th or 5th grade computer class and they were working with AI. I asked the teacher about it and he said that he found some info on this particular AI the night prior, and decided to let the kids experiment with it. That was impressive to me for some reason.\\n\\nBut then I've also read about the 2021 incident involving the music teacher. It appears that teacher was arrested and now on intense supervision. I'm going to ask the Dawson intake guy about this incident, but so far it seems to be a one-off. It definitely gives me some pause. \\n\\nWe also looked into St. Elizabeth's, but got weird vibes from that one. The school seemed to have a political agenda. \\n\\nWe looked into Ascent Charter School, which we sort of liked, but they also seemed to have a political agenda, opposite of St. Elizabeth's. \\n\\nAny feedback is appreciated.

It goes: \\n\\nArgument\\u2026.Extreme anger\\u2026yelling things he doesn\\u2019t mean OR complete silence for a day\\u2026.then back to normal like nothing happened. \\n\\nThere\\u2019s no resolve or communication about the issue that happened unless I initiate and even then I\\u2019ll just speak about how I\\u2019m feeling he gets super angry again. There\\u2019s no way to communicate with him. \\n\\nI\\u2019m so tired of feeling like asking to have a healthy communication is like pulling teeth. He says it\\u2019s better that he shuts down cause the alternative is him getting angry and saying things he doesn\\u2019t mean. \\n\\nBut the main issue is that he gets defensive and has anger problems.  His RSD is out of control. He refuses meds and just smokes weed so much so that he admits it\\u2019s an addiction. I\\u2019m in individual therapy and he used to be, but stopped going. \\nMy therapist recommended couples counseling but I feel like he\\u2019s just going to manipulate the counselor or \\u201cbe good\\u201d for them and I\\u2019m gonna end up looking like the problem.   \\n\\nFor context:\\nWe went to pick up our groceries and they left out some our items. The worker that dropped them off raised his voice at my husband and that\\u2019s when he started taking it out on me. Before we go in to the store he says \\u201clet ME do the talking\\u201d \\nI went to the trunk and told him to write down the items we were missing and he said \\u201cit\\u2019s more efficient if we write down what we have instead\\u201d and I was like \\u201cno just write down what\\u2019s missing\\u201d because then we could be sure we wouldn\\u2019t leave without what was missing after they hopefully brought it out and he goes \\u201cfine we\\u2019ll do it YOUR way\\u201d and we get in there and I asked which desk he thought to go to and he said \\u201cidk this is all you since you want to be in charge\\u201d and then just stopped talking to me. \\n\\nWe actually had a conversation afterwards about what happened and he said that he took control of the situation because he saw me \\u201cshrinking in my seat and getting anxious, but if I feel like my anxiety is getting better and I can handle more situations then I can by all means do that\\u201d. But  I wasn\\u2019t anxious at all during the grocery thing. I only started to get upset when he said \\u201clet ME do the talking\\u201d and raised his voice. \\nI feel like he\\u2019s manipulating me. And I just need some 3rd party advice.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9881,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DemonolatryPractices\",\n          \"AboveandBeyond\",\n          \"VirtualYoutubers\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 72656,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['temporary', 'body', 'realized', 'today', 'body', 'forever', 'soul', 'elsewhere', 'agree', 'someday', 'body', 'stay', 'earth', 'anymore', 'makes', 'nicer', 'body', 'wonder', 'miss', 'slow']\",\n          \"['experiences', 'elegoo', 'standard', '2.0', 'resin', '2.0', 'version', 'elegoo', 'standard', 'resin', 'information', 'asked', 'service@elegoo.com', 'mailto', 'service@elegoo.com', 'response', 'standard', 'resin', '2.0', 'better', 'scratch', 'resistance', 'lower', 'shrinkage', 'higher', 'printing', 'accuracy', \\\"i'd\\\", 'gather', 'experiences', 'resin', 'comment', 'section', 'kg', '2.0', 'resin', '\\u20ac', 'europe', 'old', '1.0', 'standard', 'resin', '\\u20ac', 'abs-like', '2.0', 'amazon.com', '):', 'quote', 'amazon.com', 'abs-like', 'resin', '2.0', 'higher', 'precision', '1.0', 'reducing', 'volume', 'shrinkage', 'photocuring', 'process', 'ideal', 'choice', 'resin', 'prints', 'require', 'resistance', 'strain', 'stress']\",\n          \"['parents', 'world', 'recently', 'epiphany', 'self', 'harming', 'behaviour', 'pleasing', 'voicing', \\\"one's\\\", 'boundaries', 'needs', 'comes', 'childhood', 'adapted', 'strategies', 'hopes', 'avoiding', 'conflict', 'nparent', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'child', 'needs', 'parents', 'gentle', 'caring', 'adult', 'parents', 'care', 'adult', 'care', 'themself', 'please', \\\"else's\\\", 'told', 'inner', 'child', 'taking', 'care', 'world', 'parents', 'explained', 'parents', 'behaviour', 'resemble', 'majority', 'therefore', 'pleasing', 'walking', 'eggshells', 'longer', 'necessary', 'parent', 'approve', 'care', 'since', 'calmer', 'becoming', 'easier', 'speak', 'mind', 'colleagues', 'noticed', 'may', 'obvious', 'truly', 'deeply', 'realised', 'helped', 'put', 'perspective', 'maybe', 'helps', 'else', 'well', \\\"that's\\\", 'sharing']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 75407,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"8ae86d94210abac28fa319e40d23cf4653888394a793d8e3b46a0e442fdf71ed\",\n          \"owqxo0\",\n          \"76a3ea56f6288fe8a82f67d2a950a698968b2038677bc846c3f008199eda665b\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write to CSV\n","final_df.to_csv('merged_minus_intersection.csv', index=False)\n","final_df.to_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/mml/datasets/merged_minus_intersection.csv', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"mYDdCZKkP97N","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1710961509828,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":56,"user":{"displayName":"Dorothea Swift","userId":"16691220920651938240"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
