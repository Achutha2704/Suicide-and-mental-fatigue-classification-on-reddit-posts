The series, which takes place in a historical era, features characters as well as historical places. The series itself tries to tackle serious topics such as the culture of war and trauma. And yet it's all ruined by typical anime accretions.\\n\\n**Let's start with the fight:**\\n\\nYou have the whole historical setting so why can't the fight also be historical. This means that swords do not cut armor. A twelve-year-old boy doesn't jump five meters into the air. Thorkell (historical figure) is not a rocket launcher.\\n\\nAll this overkill ruins the message of the show. If you want to criticize the Viking culture, you don't need to exaggerate it. A more realistic fight (it doesn't have to be motion capture with HEMA instructors, of course) would make the topic more meaningful.\\n\\n**Drawing emotions**\\n\\nWe'll look at the scene where Einar gets mad. The pupils of his eyes disappear, he begins to wheeze terribly. But why do something like that? It's supposed to show his anger, but it's harder to empathize with the character when her gestures don't look natural. Wouldn't it be better to allow realistic facial expressions?\\n\\nOr meeting his sister. Why add a background from outer space and a blow to destroy a wooden wall? Instead of characters, I see their caricatures. This reminds me of Subaru's situation in Re:zero (I'm not saying this show doesn't have the above problems). Subaru uses exaggerated gestures he learned from the anime to hide his insecurities and true emotions, but it makes other characters distrust him because they see a clown.\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\nI am not saying that these tools should be removed from the industry entirely. I wish anime would specialize in using them. The exaggeration of emotions should be left to the comedy. Exaggerated action for fantasy, etc. Then these tropes would not become commonplace and would be better used in their respective genres.\",\n          \"I am pretty much brand new to the hobby, I mean I\\u2019ve read a couple of the books and learned a lot of the lore, but I only recently started painting models in preparation to learn the game at a hobby shop.

The series, which takes place in a historical era, features characters as well as historical places. The series itself tries to tackle serious topics such as the culture of war and trauma. And yet it's all ruined by typical anime accretions.\\n\\n**Let's start with the fight:**\\n\\nYou have the whole historical setting so why can't the fight also be historical. This means that swords do not cut armor. A twelve-year-old boy doesn't jump five meters into the air. Thorkell (historical figure) is not a rocket launcher.\\n\\nAll this overkill ruins the message of the show. If you want to criticize the Viking culture, you don't need to exaggerate it. A more realistic fight (it doesn't have to be motion capture with HEMA instructors, of course) would make the topic more meaningful.\\n\\n**Drawing emotions**\\n\\nWe'll look at the scene where Einar gets mad. The pupils of his eyes disappear, he begins to wheeze terribly. But why do something like that? It's supposed to show his anger, but it's harder to empathize with the character when her gestures don't look natural. Wouldn't it be better to allow realistic facial expressions?\\n\\nOr meeting his sister. Why add a background from outer space and a blow to destroy a wooden wall? Instead of characters, I see their caricatures. This reminds me of Subaru's situation in Re:zero (I'm not saying this show doesn't have the above problems). Subaru uses exaggerated gestures he learned from the anime to hide his insecurities and true emotions, but it makes other characters distrust him because they see a clown.\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\nI am not saying that these tools should be removed from the industry entirely. I wish anime would specialize in using them. The exaggeration of emotions should be left to the comedy. Exaggerated action for fantasy, etc. Then these tropes would not become commonplace and would be better used in their respective genres.\",\n          \"I am pretty much brand new to the hobby, I mean I\\u2019ve read a couple of the books and learned a lot of the lore, but I only recently started painting models in preparation to learn the game at a hobby shop. These are the first 3 of my Dark Angels combat patrol that I have finished. I\\u2019ve done what I can with my less than steady hands and tried to add some character with the weathering and scratches on their armor.
